Amid this Covid pandemic, This is a detector that can find whether you are followin the social distance rule through first detecting pedestrian/person using yolov3 and then calculating the distance between all the persons to check if they are the required distance apart! 
Note: In the code the distance is checked using a paramter of pixel distance (scaled to the actual distance.For this the setting of camera is very much required and may differ in every situation.
Also note the yolo weights have to be downloaded from the internet to use the model.
